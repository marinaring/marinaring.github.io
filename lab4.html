							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							
								<p> This lab was an introduction to working with our STM32 microcontroller boards. After learning how to read a reference manual and datasheet and learning how clocks work on a microcontroller, 
									we were tasked with configuring clocks, timers, and I/O  in order to drive a speaker to play a song. A lot of this lab required close reading and attention to detail. It was a good lesson
									in taking my time and using the Segger Embedded Studio debugger to my advantage. I had a lot of fun with this lab, in the end playing "September" by Earth, Wind, and Fire on the speaker!
									See the <a href="https://hmc-e155.github.io/lab/lab4/">E155 Lab 4 Page</a> for a more detailed overview of the specifications and instructions for this lab.</p> 
								
								<p>	All code written for this lab can be found on my <a href = "https://github.com/marinaring/E155-lab4">E155 Lab 4 Repository on Github.</a></p>

										The circuit diagram for this circuit is shown to the left. The circuit is relatively simple: it contains an LM386 audio amplifier to drive the speaker
										while ensuring that current draw stays within allowable levels for the microcontroller as well as a potentiometer to allow for volume control. The potentiometer especially came in handy while testing the 
										code over and over again!

								<div style="display: inline-block;">
									<p>
										In order to output a square wave signal from the microcontroller, I took advantage of the Timer 15 and Timer 16 registers. Both are able to be configured to a PWM mode and connected to a GPIO pin 
										in alternate function mode in order to produce a square wave output. Each Timer has its own counter that is compared to a value set when configuring the register. When the counter is less than this 
										compare/contrast value, it outputs a high signal (or 1). When the counter is greater or equal to this compare/contrast value, it outputs a low signal (or 0). 
										<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										For this lab, we were tasked with producing pitches with accuracies within 1% across the frequency range of 220-1000 Hz. To achieve this constraint, I ran a timing analysis using 
										Excel and the equations listed below. Because I used phase-locked-loop to clock the microcontroller at 80 MHz, I needed to use a prescaler to produce these lower frequencies. The equations I used 
										are detailed below. 

										
										
										\[ f_{CNT} = \frac{f_{clk}}{PSC + 1} \]
										\[ \frac{1}{f_{sound}} = \frac{1}{f_{CNT}} * cycles \]
										\[ cycles = \frac{f_{clk}}{f_{sound} (PSC + 1)} \]
										\[ f_{sound} = \frac{f_{clk}}{cycles (PSC + 1)} \]
										
									</p>
									<p>
										The minimum and maximum duration and frequency supported can be calculated by considering when the compare/contrast value is set to 0 and when it is set to its max value, which is 
										$$2^{16} - 1 = 65535$$ for a
										16 bit register.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Below, I have included the table detailing the values I calculated to ensure that the frequencies outputted by Timer 16 produced pitches in the range of 220-1000 Hz within 1% accuracy. I chose
										to use a prescaler value of 999 for Timer 16, which output a PWM signal to the speaker. Given a prescaler value of 999, the maximum frequency able to be produced is 80 kHz using a compare/contrast value of 0. 
										The minimum frequency able to be produced is 1.22 Hz using a compare/contrast value of 65535.

								<div style="display: inline-block;">
									<p>
										I performed a similar analysis in order to determine the prescaler value needed to ensure proper durations for all notes. A table is shown below detailing the calculated values. I chose to use a prescaler
										of 1999 for Timer 15, which was used to produce delays in milliseconds. Given a prescaler value of 1999, the maximum duration able to be produced is 1.64 seconds using a compare/contrast value of 65535. 
										The minimum duration able to be produced is 0.025 milliseconds.

										I am proud to present a video of my final results below! First the microcontroller plays Fur Elise, then it plays September by Earth, Wind, and Fire. I used the website 
										<a href ="https://www.hooktheory.com/">Hook Theory</a> to get the notes for the song, and then transcribed it using the chart on the <a href = "https://hmc-e155.github.io/lab/lab4">Lab 4 Page</a>.

										I successfully compiled and uploaded my code to the STM32 microcontroller. The design meets all of the <a href = "https://hmc-e155.github.io/lab/lab4/specs.html">requirements</a>.

										This lab took me an estimated 15 hours to complete.
